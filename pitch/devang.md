  ## Product Validation
]
.right-column[


> Testing the founders' assumptions by deploying the product in the real world and calibrating expectations to reality

- Quantitative

  - By obtaning metrics that measure the effectiveness of the product

  - Page views, user flow, user behavior, etc.,


- Qualitative

  - User interviews

  - Online survey

  - Personal email

]

???

- This is all about making the product successful. Ex: Fanstreamm - Group tickets
- Best way to test your assumptions is with metrics. Page views, user flow between the pages, observing user behavior, gauging the demand for the product, user actions
- Empirical confirmation from actual users. Behavior is directed by what we build, the quantitative metrics only tell us what is or is not working but it is the qualitative measures that tell us the why
- Talk to the user

> You wanted an ecommerce platform similar to Flipkart, Amazon, etc.,

> Depending on the scale you have three options

1. Wordpress

2. Shopify

3. Custom built

]

- We are lacking in information about the scale and details of the product
- How many users do you anticipate?
- How many products?
- What categories etc., So this is about a general

  ## Wordpress
]
.right-column[

> Wordpress is the cheapest and most customizable option available

- Small scale

- Free/ Almost free

- Web only

- Needs some technical expertise to maintain, hosting, security, etc.,

- Can launch quickly on the web

- No access to source code

]
???

- We can help you with setting this up initially. The turnaround time on this is quite low.
- This is the cheapest option available. You do not have to pay for the core software, including the shopping cart
- It's almost free because you will have to pay for any of the plugins for bruteprotect, responsiveness, etc.,

  ## The .red[Product]
  ## Shopify
]
.right-column[

> Lot of options but comes with the price

- Very stable web only product

- Has most of the features covered

- Not highly scalable but better than wordpress

- Starter plans are pricey with limited functionality

- Full functionality comes with costlier plans

- Cost prohibitive over the long term

- No access to source code

]

???

- We can help you with setting this up initially. The turnaround time on this is quite low.
- As with any off the shelf solutions after a point, customizing after a point becomes impossible
- Over the long term doesn't make a lot of sense, but the ease of use is quite high

.left-column[
  ## The .red[Product]
  ## Custom solution
]
.right-column[

> Well, it's a custom solution

- Will build for what you want

- Can build it cost effectuvely

- Will design based on the needs rather than choosing from the existing templates

- Will start with the web application, is easily extensible

- Build a RESTful API for use by the mobile applications.

- We suggest that we build an Android app initially, parallely develop an iOS app


]
???

- Be it just a launching page from the initial days, an MVP or a full scale product, we can scale with your needs
- Can extend the API to the public as well
- Android because of the % of the users that use it, but iOS is as essential because of the iOS user demographic
- We will involve you in the design process. Once the design has been agreed upon for both web and native interfaces we will start development.
- Development will be broken down to milestones and the payment will be tied to the completion of milestones.
- After deployment, we will share the code for the 15 day service period and hand it over to you on the final day.
